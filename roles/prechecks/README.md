# `prechecks` role

Part of the **network.offline_migration_sdn_to_ovnk** collection.

Runs a **comprehensive readiness assessment** _before_ starting the
OpenShiftSDN â†’ OVNKubernetes offline migration (or any rollback rehearsal).  
It surfaces blocking issues early so the actual cut-over window remains short
and predictable.

## What it does

- Check if oc client is installed and binary exists.
- Check if KUBECONFIG is set and file exists.
- Check if the current user is 'system:admin' or a user with cluster admin rights using custom module.

This role encapsulates that logic with sensible defaults and tunable
variables.

## Requirements

| Item                            | Notes |
|---------------------------------|-------|
| **OpenShift 4.12+ and <=4.16**  | Cluster admin privileges (`oc` logged in as a user with `cluster-admin`). |
| **`oc` CLI in `$PATH`**         | Used by many tasks via `ansible.builtin.command`. |
| **Ansible >= 2.18**             | Collection relies on modern plugins & loop syntax. |
