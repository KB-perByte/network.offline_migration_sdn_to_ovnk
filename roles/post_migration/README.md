# `post_migration` role  
*Part of the `network.offline_migration_sdn_to_ovnk` collection*

Performs the **post-flight validation, clean-up** tasks
after an OpenShift cluster has switched its default network from
**OpenShiftSDN** to **OVNKubernetes**.

Typical responsibilities include:

- Check all cluster operators back to normal.
- Check the CNI network provider.
- Check if all cluster nodes are in Ready state.
- Notify user about NotReady nodes.
- Confirm that no pods are in an error state.
- Notify user if any pods are in an error state.
- Patch Network.operator.openshift.io and wait for migration field to clear.
- Remove network configuration and namespace.
- Check all cluster operators back to normal.

## Requirements

| Item                            | Notes |
|---------------------------------|-------|
| **OpenShift 4.12+ and <=4.16**  | Cluster admin privileges (`oc` logged in as a user with `cluster-admin`). |
| **`oc` CLI in `$PATH`**         | Used by many tasks via `ansible.builtin.command`. |
| **Ansible >= 2.18**             | Collection relies on modern plugins & loop syntax. |
| **Python 3.12+ on control host** | Needed for the `openshift` Python client when running sanity checks. |

## Role variables

| Variable | Default | Description                                                                 |
|----------|--|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `post_migration_checks` |  |  Adds list of conditions to wait until the desired status is achieved.                   |
| `post_migration_expected_network_type` |  | Check if CNI `OVNKubernetes` was set after migration.                       |
| `post_migration_network_provider_config` |  | Checks if custom network configuration for `openshiftSDNConfig` is deleted. |
| `post_migration_namespace` |  | Checks if namespace `openshift-sdn` is deleted after migration.             |

> **Tip** â€“ override only what you need; place customised variables in a
> host-vars file or pass them at runtime with `-e`.
